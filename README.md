# rexydog

This site is all about my dog, Rex. He's a Border Terrier and he's totally cool.

In this project I'm exploring:

<ul>
  <li>Basic markup</li>
  <li>HTML5 semantic layout</li>
  <li>CSS Style experimentation</li>
  <li>Mobile first design</li>
  <li>CSS Grid</li>
  <li>Nested grids</li>
  <li>Responsive layout with media queries</li>
  <li>JS Lightbox</li>
</ul>

As a junior developer, I needed a project to draw together some of the front-end fundamentals that I've been learning, putting the theory into practice.

I've also found layout customisation frustrating in the past, and was intrigued by the introduction of CSS Grid. This project was a great opportunity to get to grips with the key concepts and syntax.

Please feel free to reference the structure, styling or JS in your own projects.
