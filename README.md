# RexyDog

This site is all about my dog, Rex. He's a Border Terrier and he's totally cool.

## Background

As a junior developer, I needed a project to draw together some of the front-end fundamentals that I've been learning, putting the theory into practice.

I've also found layout customisation frustrating in the past (i.e. floats, clears etc. always felt like more of a 'workaround'), and was intrigued by the introduction of CSS Grid. 

This project was a great opportunity to get to grips with the key concepts and syntax.
